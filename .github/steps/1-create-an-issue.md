## Step 1: Creating an Issue :rocket:

Welcome to GitHub Issues!

### :question: What is an Issue?

An **Issue** is a task, bug, or feature request that you can track and follow up on within a project. It's a great way to manage tasks and let your team know what needs to be done.

The best way to start tracking work is by opening an Issue. When creating an issue, you can write a clear description and label it to improve team clarity. Aim for a concise and detailed description of the task at hand, including any relevant context.
